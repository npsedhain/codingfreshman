I used to dread code reviews. It felt like carving yourself open to invite judgmental comments. I did not look forward to it.

It even felt like a waste of time. Updating variable names, changing function orders, simplifying logic, and following stylistic guidelines. I didn’t see a point to it and hated when that happened.

And if you are anything like I used to be, you hate it too. You doubt your own abilities when you read through PR comments and worse, each PR comment discourages you.

I remember when I used to feel that way.

But I went past it. I overcame my fear. Today I look forward to code reviews and honestly, it is one of the better portions of my day.

In this post, I will share how I changed my perspective toward code reviews and how you can do it too. (And why you should.)

It was a normal day at the office (back when I used to work from an actual office space with 50 others in the same hall). I had just opened a PR and was taking a moment before going through the remaining tickets in the sprint. That’s when I hear one of my senior colleagues burst out into laughter. Everyone’s heads turn towards him. Who doesn't want a good laugh?

I reach his desk and see what was so funny on screen that everyone around him had joined in for a laugh. I saw it - he was reviewing my code. I didn’t know how to react. I smiled but I also went red with embarrassment.

As he was laughing, he removed a big chunk of code and replaced it with a single line. At that moment, I went from being embarrassed to being amazed. I thought to myself, “Why didn’t I think of that? It’s so simple.”

This experience changed how I perceived code reviews. Although at the beginning it might have made me a bit skeptical and more fearful of opening a PR. I was wary of being a laughing stock again. In retrospect, that experience did more good than bad.

I started checking my own code. To catch any sections where I could improve. Soon enough I started seeing those quirks myself. I went the extra mile to come up with a better solution. All those variable name changes and function order changes started to make more sense. They made my code more readable. After all, we are writing codes for humans.

I also started reviewing other people’s codes. That’s when I realized that nobody writes perfect code all the time. Sometimes even the most senior developers make silly mistakes. And how they handled the situation without feeling a bit of insult was something I could learn from. After all, we are always learning. What helped me was taking myself less seriously and the process a bit more lightly. (You don’t need to wear your heart on your sleeves all the time.)

Instead of being wary that my code would make people laugh. I started looking forward to such moments because it meant I would learn something interesting and important. I started seeing code reviews as an opportunity to learn.

But the feeling that you are learning alone doesn’t make you look forward to events. We all need to have some fun, right?

And to my surprise, I was having fun. Addressing comments became the time for me to unwind from stress. Break the monotony of writing codes all day. It was also a time when colleagues in my team came together to solve a problem. We have come up with a lot of good ideas during this time. Code reviews have become a fruitful and fun team engagement activity for us.

Today I have developed a lens through which I see my own work from someone else’s perspective. I go through my code multiple times before getting opinions from others. I have become a conscious and careful developer.

I have formed a habit of giving each PR an extra hour of walk-through. I do not rush to get my work out but carefully critique myself and see how I can come up with the best possible solution. I also catch a lot of prospective comments and make changes before the fact.

I am aware that it’s not the most time-efficient approach but it’s a healthy one. We are not competing with anyone to produce as many lines of code in the least amount of time. Your conscious effort might feel like you are taking a lot of time now. But you end up saving a lot by reducing time to refactor later. You also eliminate code smell. And you are writing maintainable code. That is a big win.

Comprehensive code reviews also mean that your code handles all edge cases and is prone to fewer bugs. You might be a stellar coder but sometimes something just doesn’t cross your mind. You will miss that hidden requirement or make a silly mistake. Hence a fresh set of eyes is not just a good to have but a must-have. Always consider code reviews as a positive and constructive situation.

I have also realized that however hard I try to catch my own mistakes, I do get a lot of comments. But let me tell you what a lot of comments don’t mean.

It doesn’t mean you are doing a bad job - far from it.

One thing you should start doing is to stop getting offended when someone suggests a change. The process of learning during code reviews goes both ways. Remember that the person who is reviewing is also learning from what you have done.

Sometimes a lot of comments mean a difference of opinion. Rather than taking it as a command, take it as an opportunity to make your thought process clearer. Don’t ever get defensive, respond with a question and discuss further to get on the same page. Remember you both want the best for the team and for the software you are writing.

Never shy away from asking a lot of questions. What you are doing with code reviews is you are harnessing somebody else’s brain power. And doing so is not a sign of weakness. It is actually a sign of wisdom.

Until next time, happy coding!
