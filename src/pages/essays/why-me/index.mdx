Disclaimer - this is not the technical side of me.
If you want to get to that directly, take a look at my portfolio [here](/portfolio).


1. I am foolish.

I am foolish enough to believe I can do something without knowing a single thing about it. I just begin. I have realized not knowing how complicated things get can actually be used to my advantage. I uncovered this about me when I built a minimal version of React back in 2019. I was just starting to code.

2. I am hungry.

I have this insatiable hunger for knowledge. In my pursuit of more knowledge, I came up with a rule recently for the small choices I make through out the day. I ask myself these two questions for any activity I come across (apart from the necessary routine) -
- Will I learn anything new?
- Will I have fun? (Having fun helps)

The best choice is when it leads to both. For me, it is - reading, solving problems, and writing.

3. I am jealous.

I am jealous of everyone around me who I think Is better. The competitive person in me wants to be the best person I know. And the hard working person in me pushes me to be just that. While I may not be the smartest person to find the most efficient way, I brute force myself to get where I need to be. And as we know, as slow as it might be, brute force works!
