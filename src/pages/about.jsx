                The tech world has you believe that you need to be a child
                genius to make a good programmer. It's not true.
              </p>
              <p>
                I didn't start writing codes when I was six. Heck, I didn't even
                write a single line of code before I was in high school.
              </p>
              <p>
                When my mother brought back a computer book for me at grade 9, I
                went to school the other day to exchange it with my beloved
                Accounts book. So you know that I have never written a single
                line of code in <strong>QBASIC</strong>. I lack the basics.
              </p>
              <p>
                In high school, I was not even interested in the extra credit
                computer. But that was when I was familiarized with the words{' '}
                <strong>conio</strong> and <strong>stdio</strong>. But with
                great shame, I must tell you that I don't yet know the meaning
                or purpose of those words.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think it's about right time to tell you that I work as a full
                time software developer for a company based in California. I
                know, lucky them!
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                However, there is one thing I absolutely loved since my early
                days. And that was a mic and a stage.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was at grade 3, when I got the taste of winning. I came in
                first at a debate competition and it felt sweet. It was also my
                first ever debate and I had won over a team that always stood
                first.
              </p>
              <p>
                From then to grade 7, until I switched school, I always
                participated either in Elocution or Debate and stood not less
                than second position. I lost track of it after that, but I know
                now that I love taking the stage and uttering words.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                I guess by now you have figured out what I am trying to do here.
                I am trying to bring the little of two worlds that I am familiar
                with. Some people would say that I have had a decent success as
                a mediocre developer and I want to tell that story to the world.
