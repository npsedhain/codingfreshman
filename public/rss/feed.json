            "content_html": "<p>Four years ago, I had a failed startup. The only company I applied for an internship rejected me. My final semester was coming to an end. And I hadn’t felt more lost.</p>\n<img alt=\"confused software developer\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fconfused.cdc1d31d.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fconfused.cdc1d31d.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" width=\"6000\" height=\"4000\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"color:transparent\"/>\n<p>Today, I am a full-time software developer. I have helped build dozens of products for clients across the globe.</p>\n<p>The journey was not an easy one. But it is something anyone can do. Only most people have difficulty starting out.</p>\n<p>I know this because a lot of college seniors have asked me, “How do I get started?” You can either spend four years figuring out the journey yourself or spend 5 minutes reading through this article.</p>\n<p>So back to me in 2019. I decided I would give it a second try. With enough preparation this time around, I got accepted. I was in for a rigorous 3 month-long internship program.</p>\n<p>23 soon-to-graduate students in the same room, all fighting to land a job. I felt an immense sense of competition, and I am sure everyone there did. No one actually addressed the tension in that room but each one of us wanted to be better than the next person.</p>\n<p>Why am I telling you all this? I want you to create the same environment as we had in there.</p>\n<p>No, I am not asking you to go internship hunting. While I am sure that will work, it might not be as feasible. Instead, find someone who is as passionate about learning as you are. And hold each other accountable for whatever it is you do. There you go, that’s step one.</p>\n<p>I recommend you find a partner because of what I realized in that internship. The power of healthy competition.</p>\n<p>In that room, we were all pushing each another to do better. And, if someone looked ahead of you, you pushed yourself more. That’s why finding someone to share a journey with is so crucial. Healthy competition keeps you going.</p>\n<p>Now you may be wondering, what do I actually do once I have a partner? Good question. That’s step two.</p>\n<p>It’s simple. Work on projects you will love. Simple, not easy.</p>\n<p>One of my friends in that internship decided he is going to build a game. And not any game. It was Doodle jump. I am sure you loved it as a child.</p>\n<p>He was nervous when he chose the game. There were a lot of unknowns. The sensors, the tunnels, the haptics, the sound, the villains - too complicated for everyone in that room. But it was not the same for him in a few days’ time (btw it’s still complicated for me to this day).</p>\n<p>As days passed by, his project outpaced the rest of ours. Not because he was the best coder in the room. But it was because he loved the game. He googled his way through any hurdles that came between him and the final version of the game he was so familiar with.</p>\n<p>In two weeks, he iterated the game many times. Finally, his version ended up becoming a complete replica of Doodle Jump. I could see the pride on his face and it was well deserved.</p>\n<p>He chose the project because he loved it. He didn&#x27;t choose something that was easy or challenging or something that made sense.</p>\n<p>I ask you to do the same. Don’t try to make sense of your very first project. Because nothing makes sense at first. Take that one thing you love and begin. You will either succeed or fail but either way, you will learn, and most importantly you will get started.</p>\n<p>And you know what? We loved his project. Fellow interns, and mentors. Everyone surrounded him. Everyone wanted to play the game and say something. This brings me to my final point.</p>\n<p>Publish your work. It’s not an option. It is non-negotiable. You could build the future of humankind but if it stays in your computer, it does not matter.</p>\n<p>What matters is publishing any tiny, embarrassing, unoriginal thing you create. The mistake most people make is they completely ignore this step. They feel like they did the job once they have something on their computer.</p>\n<p>But I argue that this is the most important and difficult step of the three. You will feel exposed and vulnerable, but you must publish.</p>\n<p>Remember I told you how my friend’s project went through many iterations? It was only possible because of all the feedback he received.</p>\n<p>He got a lot of ideas from his audience and that made his work a lot more desirable, which attracted even more people. This created a positive feedback loop and as a result, his project was better. He learned a lot. And if you consider landing a job a success, he succeeded.</p>\n<p>Perform these three steps, and I am confident that you will find yourself getting a hang of things. You will stop feeling lost as I did.</p>\n<p>Even better, repeat the process a couple of times. I will guarantee you will find yourself falling in love with software development.</p>\n<p>Until next time, happy coding!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>My outlook on life changed three years ago. My life has been completely upended since then.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" srcSet=\"/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fwhat-i-want.566f082a.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x\" src=\"/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fwhat-i-want.566f082a.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" width=\"2172\" height=\"3862\" decoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"color:transparent\"/>\n<p>Before I start, let me tell you about the conversation I had with my then-girlfriend five years ago.</p>\n<p>I told her, “I don’t have big dreams. A good-paying job, being able to do what I love and spending time with my family on a daily basis. That’s all I want as an adult.” And I know that I meant every word of what I said. My then-girlfriend almost flinched when she heard it.</p>\n<p>She told me about how small I dreamt and that she and I couldn’t build a future together if that is what I really wanted.</p>\n<p>I was sad, obviously.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a couple of years and I had a job. A stable one, just as I had thought. Even paid above market price. It was not even that demanding, so I was spending ample time with people I loved. I even thought I loved what I did.</p>\n<p>I really loved creating things. Bringing beautiful Figma designs to life and curating APIs that added soul to the otherwise dumb UI skeletons.</p>\n<p>I was content with the bare minimum that I had achieved. Until one fine day at Himalayan Java, when my friend asked me to team up for projects that paid nothing but we would own it. I liked the ring to it. Even though it was unlike what I had imagined myself doing, I was excited and jumped right in.</p>\n<p>My friend was more of a risk-taker than I ever could be. Didn’t have a stable paying job like I did but still wanted to build things for himself. I liked that about him and in ways made me want to be more like him.</p>\n<p>That brought me to my era of 16-hour work days. I used to go to the office at 9 in the morning, get back at 7, and worked till 2 at night or sometimes even later.</p>\n<p>The funny thing looking back to that era was that I absolutely loved it. I was excited to go to work knowing that when I get back home, I would be in a different light, different setting, working at a completely different thing that nourished my soul (cliche, I know but I don’t have other words to explain that feeling).</p>\n<p>In a strange way, this made me feel like I lived two separate lives. I felt like Peter Parker as a cameraman at the office and as a Spiderman during the night. And I was successful at being both.</p>\n<p>This unlocked my potential. I couldn’t have imagined working 10 hours a day and suddenly I found myself working through the day and night and doing it all over again tomorrow. I started loving who I was and what I was doing during the night time more than my day counterpart. I mean who would still love clicking pictures if they get to be a Spiderman, right?</p>\n<p>I still remember it was around 1 am in the morning when I was working on logic to replace a legal template with a form data provided and had to curate a legal contract. I had been working on it for a couple days and I had finally cracked it. It was probably my most satisfying day until then.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks later, my friend and I were having a somewhat serious conversation regarding our future in Nepal. He had asked, “What is it you really want to do in your life? I told him, “I have big dreams. I want to build my own company that specializes in a niche and will be absolutely loved by at least a thousand people. That’s what I want to do.”</p>",
